# Scripts

These scripts are written in Lua and extend Solarus capabilities.

- [Visual Novel System](https://gitlab.com/ShargonPendragon/visual-novel-system) - Adds visual novel and dialog box customization options to Solarus.
- [Pathfinder](https://gitlab.com/llamazing/pathfinder) - Finds a route to a destination while traveling along a road network (useful for traveling NPCs). Includes an example quest where the hero moves around a large procedurally generated map.
