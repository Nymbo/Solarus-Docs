# Introduction

Solarus itself is only a game engine, and does not provide any content. You will need to find or create your own sprites, music, sounds, maps, etc.

However, the Solarus community has prepared some content that can be used for prototyping or as part of a complete quest. There is also some information on other tools people find work well with Solarus.
